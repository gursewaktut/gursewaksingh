India's data on cybercrime, sourced from data.gov.in, formed the foundation of my project aimed at understanding crime prevention techniques. Utilizing a range of datasets, I analyzed cybercrime patterns across different states, focusing on demographic variables such as age, gender, and geographic location. Employing data evaluation and machine learning techniques, I identified significant disparities in cybercrime incidence among various demographic groups. The findings highlighted a marked underrepresentation of male-targeted cybercrimes and emphasized the heightened vulnerability of women and children, pointing to potential biases in data collection and reporting processes.

India's cybercrime data also revealed insights into the governmental response to these threats, especially concerning the global rise in scam calls often traced back to India. My analysis advocated for improved documentation and transparency of cybercrime data to enhance the accuracy of machine learning models designed to predict vulnerable areas and demographics. The project achieved a predictive accuracy of 75% in identifying regions and populations most at risk, underscoring the need for more balanced data. The recommendations included future research directions for developing methodologies to detect and correct biases in crime data, aiming to contribute significantly to policy formulation and the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures in India.

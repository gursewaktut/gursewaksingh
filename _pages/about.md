My name is Gursewak Singh, and I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Computing Science at SFU. I am good at web development and currently I am also involved in a group project at SFU Surge projects. I also possess a solid understanding of Linux OS.

I am a dedicated individual with a passion for utilizing technology to solve real-world problems. I am eager to further develop my skills and contribute to the exciting technological advances that happen every day. In addition to my studies, I like to play around with electronics and microcontrollers.

I am also an avid reader and one of my favorite books is [One Hundred Years Of Solitude By Gabriel García Márquez](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude). I work as a part-time Transport Mechanic, where I am responsible for managing employees and delegating work. This dual exposure to both computing science and mechanical systems has provided me with a unique perspective and a diverse skill set.
